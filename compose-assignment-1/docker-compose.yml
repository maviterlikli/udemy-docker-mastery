# Assignment: Writing a Compose File

# Goal: Create a compose config for a local Drupal CMS website

# This empty directory is where you should create a docker-compose.yml 
# Use the `drupal:8.8.2` image along with the `postgres:12.1` image
services:
  drupal:
    image: drupal:8.8.2
    volumes:
      - ./www/html/modules:/var/www/html/modules
      - ./www/html/profiles:/var/www/html/profiles
      - ./www/html/themes:/var/www/html/themes
    ports:
    - "8080:80"
    restart: always
  postgres:
    image: postgres:12.1
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD: 7589
    restart: always
# Set the version to 2
# Use `ports` to expose Drupal on 8080
# Be sure to setup POSTGRES_PASSWORD on postgres image
# Walk through Drupal config in browser at http://localhost:8080
# Tip: Drupal assumes DB is localhost, but it will actually be on the compose service name you give it
# Use Docker Hub documentation to figure out the right environment and volume settings
# Extra Credit: Use volumes to store Drupal unique data
